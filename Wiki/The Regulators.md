*We're Regulators.*
*We regulate any problem our clients need us to. We're damn good too. But you can't be any geek off the street, gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep.*

The Regulators are a mercenary group founded in approximately 26,303 by Nathan Canis and Warren Gith.

They are brutal, efficient, and professional. No incidental casualties. Never taken a contract from Mind Flayers or Neogi. No kids.

The Regulators prefer to operate outside of Vaardspace to avoid Emerald Armada interference.  When they do need to work inside Vaard borders, they ensure that their operations are either ignored by the Armada, or they get out before they're noticed.

If you have a problem, if you have the money, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The Regulators.
