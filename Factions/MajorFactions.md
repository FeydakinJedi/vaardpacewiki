### Emerald Armada

### Dragons
Dragons inspire awe and fear in all spheres in the cosmos. They are known across the planes. They seem to be a ubiquitous in every corner of existence.

Dragon-kin call themselves The Children of Oshumare (pronounced oh-shoo-MAH-ray). Little is known about the god they call Oshumare. Dragon-kin legend states this deity is above Bahamut and Tiamat, and that all dragon-kind are descended from a clutch of Oshumare's eggs.

Dragons claim that they are the first creatures to exist in the material plane. No evidence has been found to contradict this assertion. Indeed, dragons can be found in the records of every civilization, including the Arcane.

Dragons are also effectively immortal. A wyrmling, left on its own with adequate sustenance, will not die of natural causes. Instead, it will grow in size and magical power until it becomes a demigod. Dragons establish cults dedicated to their individual worship, but even greatwyrms pay reverence Oshumare.

Dragonkind is not a monoculture. Some dragons remain aloof from the affairs of lesser beings, and some are actively involved in the affairs of others. The most ancient of the greatwyrms, especially those that live in space, maintain a loose confederation. The inner workings of this organization are kept closely guarded, with only the most trusted high priests and devotees being granted knowledge of their discussions. 

When the cataclysm occurred, dragons made an alliance with the high elves who came from the Feywild the cosmos to defeat a great evil. As a reward for their assistance, the dragons granted the elves the use of spelljamming ships and showed them a few hyperlane routes through the phlogiston. The elves promised to be good stewards of the spaceways by eliminating slavery within their protectorate and by hunting and destroying aberrations.

Dragons do not readily reveal knowledge about the cosmos. Even when discussing prosaic matters, dragons will often speak in poetry or riddles. They claim that such unclear language is a better approximation of their own speech, and thereby conveys a greater truth, but that lesser beings are unable to fathom their message. Many think that they are just being coy.

Dragons do not like it when explorers or travelers trespass in their territory. Whether it be a horde under a mountain, a quasar, or a reserved hyperlane route. Most significantly, dragons have never allowed anyone--including the Emerald Armada--to enter the region surrounding the core of the Greater Sphere. No quarter is given to those who do not turn away at the first warning.
### Neogi Hegemony 
The Neogi Hegemony is a fleet of vicious aberrations who abduct any vessels they perceive as weak and subject them to mind-control. Their fleet controls a large area of spheres adjacent to Vaardspace. They are commiting the majority of their ships, troops, and resources to the invasion and subjugation of Vaardspace.

Individual neogi seek to psychically control other beings. If you can convince a neogi you are willful or that you are a credible them, they may forego attempting to control you and be willing to trade. Some beings favor trading with the neogi for the rare materials and weapons they stockpile. But the neogi are also known for trading in other beings. Neogi have no moral qualms against enslaving others, whether by psychic means, as prisoners, through financial obligations, or via psychochemical manipulation.

It is unknown how long neogi have existed in the galaxy, but they have been present at least the time of the Arcane. 
### Star Cogs
The Star Cogs are a group of inventors and artificers who worship Gond. The Star Cogs were founded by gnomes who found their way into the material realm later than the elves who formed the Emerald Armada, but also before the Disconcordance. Star Cogs are the most prodigious, ambitious, and advanced inventors in the galaxy.

The early origins of the Star Cogs are shrouded by mystery, and the Cogs insist they were born among the stars. When the Armada made contact with them, they were living in a series of space stations among a debris nebula around a bright yellow star. The Cogs were thrilled to meet the elves of the Armada, and immediately began a mutually beneficial relationship.

The Star Cogs were fascinated by the spelljamming technology used by the Armada. They immediately grasped the principle, and had been on the verge of developing a similar device. Star Cogs invented various spelljammer variants including the LifeJammer, KiJammer, and MindJammer.

The Star Cogs enthusiastically welcome the construct refugees of the Vaardan-Neogi war. Many Warforged have found a home among the Star Cogs, who are delighted to learn of sentient constructs.

Star Cogs have several outposts in and around Vaardspace. Star Cogs can be found throughout the galaxy, although not in large communities.
### Dumathoin's Prospectors
Dumathoin's Prospectors are a conglomeration Dwarvish explorers and miners who prospect, harvest, and refine rare mineral resources from planets and asteroids. Dumathoin's prospectors were formed less than one thousand years after the Disconcordance. They worship the Dwarven god of mining Dumathoin, and view the extraction of mineral resources of the galaxy as a religious imperative.

Dwarven warriors who joined the elves and dragons against Vecna became an adjunct fighting force in the Armada. However, they could not resist the call of the beautiful stones and metals that they saw among the spheres. The leader of the battalion, Milagros Mineshadow, agreed to provide the Armada with refined metals and rare crystals in exchange for a small fleet of ships. The Armada agreed, and thus the Prospectors were born.

The Prospectors today operate from a huge terrestrial world they have completely filled with caverns and tunnels. From their headquarters, they send giant colony ships sculpted to look like the busts of revered ancestors. They are called Face Stations. Dumathoin's Prospectors land their Face Stations on promising worlds and go forth to extract treasures from their target planet.

The Prospectors control a region of spheres near Vaardspace, opposite the Neogi Hegemony. They operate both inside and outside the borders of Vaardspace borders. They are the primary supplier of mineral and metal products to most of the explored galaxy.
### The Illithid
Illithid. Mind Flayers. Brain worms. Intellect devourers. Parasitic consciousness made form in flesh. The illithid are  well known throughout the galaxy. If there is one thing any two wild spacers have on common, it's that illithid are horrifying, terrifying, and dangerous. Many truces have been formed to exterminate an illithid hive.

Illithid have been recorded in history since the time of the Arcane. It is unknown whether the illithid were present in the galaxy prior to the tone of the Arcane, but the Arcane have the earliest records of the illithid. 

Their forms vary, but the behavior they follow is unmistakable. Insert a parasite into the brain of a sentient (or fairly large brained) feature, metamorphose that creature into a Mind Flayer, accumulate a critical mass of parasitized brain matter, and form an Elder Brain.

Illithid are hated by dragons. Any creature capable of eliciting more than a cool, detached response from a dragon must be worthy of notice. Cosmic dragons who are well familiar with them view them as unholy and perverse, and will eliminate them by the most extreme measures.

The illithid control a large regionin  of the galaxy opposite from Vaardspace, but they are found throughout the Greater Sphere. 

Illithid are capable of individuality. Some are even charming. Most will betray you or try to eat your brain.

The illithid are unlike any other aberrations in that they do not have a singular morphology. Illithid take on the characteristics of their host. But they all evolve in a similar direction--towards an Elder Brain. It seems as though each individual illithid and each Elder Brain are all directed towards a singular goal. What that may be, we only fear to guess.
