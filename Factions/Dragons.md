# Dragons
Dragons inspire awe and fear in all spheres in the cosmos. They are known across the planes. They seem to be a ubiquitous in every corner of existence.

Dragon-kin call themselves The Children of Oshumare (pronounced oh-shoo-MAH-ray). Little is known about the god they call Oshumare. Dragon-kin legend states this deity is above Bahamut and Tiamat, and that all dragon-kind are descended from a clutch of Oshumare's eggs.

Dragons claim that they are the first creatures to exist in the material plane. No evidence has been found to contradict this assertion. Indeed, dragons can be found in the records of every civilization, including the Arcane.

Dragons are also effectively immortal. A wyrmling, left on its own with adequate sustenance, will not die of natural causes. Instead, it will grow in size and magical power until it becomes a demigod. Dragons establish cults dedicated to their individual worship, but even greatwyrms pay reverence Oshumare.

Dragonkind is not a monoculture. Some dragons remain aloof from the affairs of lesser beings, and some are actively involved in the affairs of others. The most ancient of the greatwyrms, especially those that live in space, maintain a loose confederation. The inner workings of this organization are kept closely guarded, with only the most trusted high priests and devotees being granted knowledge of their discussions. 

When the cataclysm occurred, dragons made an alliance with the high elves who came from the Feywild the cosmos to defeat a great evil. As a reward for their assistance, the dragons granted the elves the use of spelljamming ships and showed them a few hyperlane routes through the phlogiston. The elves promised to be good stewards of the spaceways by eliminating slavery within their protectorate and by hunting and destroying aberrations.

Dragons do not readily reveal knowledge about the cosmos. Even when discussing prosaic matters, dragons will often speak in poetry or riddles. They claim that such unclear language is a better approximation of their own speech, and thereby conveys a greater truth, but that lesser beings are unable to fathom their message. Many think that they are just being coy.

Dragons do not like it when explorers or travelers trespass in their territory. Whether it be a horde under a mountain, a quasar, or a reserved hyperlane route. Most significantly, dragons have never allowed anyone--including the Emerald Armada--to enter the region surrounding the core of the Greater Sphere. No quarter is given to those who do not turn away at the first warning.
