# Dumathoin's Prospectors
Dumathoin's Prospectors are a conglomeration Dwarvish explorers and miners who prospect, harvest, and refine rare mineral resources from planets and asteroids. Dumathoin's prospectors were formed less than one thousand years after the Disconcordance. They worship the Dwarven god of mining Dumathoin, and view the extraction of mineral resources of the galaxy as a religious imperative.

Dwarven warriors who joined the elves and dragons against Vecna became an adjunct fighting force in the Armada. However, they could not resist the call of the beautiful stones and metals that they saw among the spheres. The leader of the battalion, Milagros Mineshadow, agreed to provide the Armada with refined metals and rare crystals in exchange for a small fleet of ships. The Armada agreed, and thus the Prospectors were born.

The Prospectors today operate from a huge terrestrial world they have completely filled with caverns and tunnels. From their headquarters, they send giant colony ships sculpted to look like the busts of revered ancestors. They are called Face Stations. Dumathoin's Prospectors land their Face Stations on promising worlds and go forth to extract treasures from their target planet.

The Prospectors control a region of spheres near Vaardspace, opposite the Neogi Hegemony. They operate both inside and outside the borders of Vaardspace borders. They are the primary supplier of mineral and metal products to most of the explored galaxy.
