# The Illithid
Illithid. Mind Flayers. Brain worms. Intellect devourers. Parasitic consciousness made form in flesh. The illithid are  well known throughout the galaxy. If there is one thing any two wild spacers have on common, it's that illithid are horrifying, terrifying, and dangerous. Many truces have been formed to exterminate an illithid hive.

Illithid have been recorded in history since the time of the Arcane. It is unknown whether the illithid were present in the galaxy prior to the tone of the Arcane, but the Arcane have the earliest records of the illithid. 

Their forms vary, but the behavior they follow is unmistakable. Insert a parasite into the brain of a sentient (or fairly large brained) feature, metamorphose that creature into a Mind Flayer, accumulate a critical mass of parasitized brain matter, and form an Elder Brain.

Illithid are hated by dragons. Any creature capable of eliciting more than a cool, detached response from a dragon must be worthy of notice. Cosmic dragons who are well familiar with them view them as unholy and perverse, and will eliminate them by the most extreme measures.

The illithid control a large regionin  of the galaxy opposite from Vaardspace, but they are found throughout the Greater Sphere. 

Illithid are capable of individuality. Some are even charming. Most will betray you or try to eat your brain.

The illithid are unlike any other aberrations in that they do not have a singular morphology. Illithid take on the characteristics of their host. But they all evolve in a similar direction--towards an Elder Brain. It seems as though each individual illithid and each Elder Brain are all directed towards a singular goal. What that may be, we only fear to guess.
