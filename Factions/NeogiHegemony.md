# Neogi Hegemony 
The Neogi Hegemony is a fleet of vicious aberrations who abduct any vessels they perceive as weak and subject them to mind-control. Their fleet controls a large area of spheres adjacent to Vaardspace. They are commiting the majority of their ships, troops, and resources to the invasion and subjugation of Vaardspace.

Individual neogi seek to psychically control other beings. If you can convince a neogi you are willful or that you are a credible them, they may forego attempting to control you and be willing to trade. Some beings favor trading with the neogi for the rare materials and weapons they stockpile. But the neogi are also known for trading in other beings. Neogi have no moral qualms against enslaving others, whether by psychic means, as prisoners, through financial obligations, or via psychochemical manipulation.

It is unknown how long neogi have existed in the galaxy, but they have been present at least the time of the Arcane.
