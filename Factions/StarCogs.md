# Star Cogs
The Star Cogs are a group of inventors and artificers who worship Gond. The Star Cogs were founded by gnomes who found their way into the material realm later than the elves who formed the Emerald Armada, but also before the Disconcordance. Star Cogs are the most prodigious, ambitious, and advanced inventors in the galaxy.

The early origins of the Star Cogs are shrouded by mystery, and the Cogs insist they were born among the stars. When the Armada made contact with them, they were living in a series of space stations among a debris nebula around a bright yellow star. The Cogs were thrilled to meet the elves of the Armada, and immediately began a mutually beneficial relationship.

The Star Cogs were fascinated by the spelljamming technology used by the Armada. They immediately grasped the principle, and had been on the verge of developing a similar device. Star Cogs invented various spelljammer variants including the LifeJammer, KiJammer, and MindJammer.

The Star Cogs enthusiastically welcome the construct refugees of the Vaardan-Neogi war. Many Warforged have found a home among the Star Cogs, who are delighted to learn of sentient constructs.

Star Cogs have several outposts in and around Vaardspace. Star Cogs can be found throughout the galaxy, although not in large communities.
