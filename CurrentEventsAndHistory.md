### Recent History
Perhaps the most significant development is that Vaardland, a fractured planetoid that was fiercely guarded by the Armada, whose inhabitants were unaware that they lived in a crystal sphere in space, has been opened to the rest of Vaardspace. Why the planetoid was isolated remains a mystery. It now serves as the Emeralds Armada headquarters.

The opening of Vaard was precipitated by major events that began on the planetoid but had implications that would affect the Greater Sphere.

The first was a Drowish invasion plan that very nearly overran Vaard. Over the past few centuries,the powerful Queen Nezznara amassed a large army and vegan a slow invasion of Vaard. Her goal was to steal The Hand and Eye of Vecna.

Nezznara was thwarted by three adventurers who are famous today, The Heroes of Vaardland: Yvarie Galanodel, the renowned lore mistress and confoundingly talented banjo player; A gnome called Kevin; and Ernhait, the Hammer of Tyr.

These three adventurers were native to Vaardland and, like all others who lived there, were completely unaware that their continent was floating inside a crystal sphere in space.  They discovered the truth of their world while thwarting a githyanki pirate raid on an Armada vessel transporting The Sword of Kas to Vaardland. 

Shortly afterward, they defeated a Vaardan hobgoblin warlord named Nosbor who had been aiding Nezznara's infiltration of Vaardland. After Neznarra's defeat, Nosbor obtained The Eye of Vecna and was preparing to conquer the planetoid. Afterwards, he intended to take any Armada ships he could and establish his own intersphereal empire.

Yvarie, Kevin, and Ernhait killed Nosbor, destroyed the Eye and Hand of Vecna, and brokered a truce between Nosbor's horde and the other nations of Vaardland. With the threat of Vecna eliminated, Vaardspace was at peace.

Admiral Luthias Liaren commanded Armada activites around Vaardland during the Drowish invasion, and the battle with Nosbor. Liaren was completely unaware of Nezznara's plot and seemed completely unconcerned about Nosbor's hostilities until The Heroes intervened. The Heroes not only thwarted the villains at home, but they discovered a battalion of warforged whom the neogi had stationed in hidden catacombs beneath Harborcrown.

Liaren's hedonism had gotten the better of him. He had been deceived and played by a faction within Harborcrown who had allied themselves with Nezznara. Were it not for the Heroes, Vaardland would have been lost and the Armada would have been compromised by the Neogi Hegemony.

Due to his massive failings, Liaren was honorably discharged from the Armada. Fleet operations around Vaardland came under the command of Allorienne Arandeiros, who was promoted to Admiral. 

Arandeiros served in Liaren's command for three hundred years, and distinguished herself time and time again. She commanded fleet operations near Vaardspace and was granted Captaincy over the Gilgalad Thule, the Elven Armada flagship. She effectively ran the show while Liaren indulged himself. 

Admiral Arandeiros rapidly achieved several successes. She brokered peace between the tribes in Nosbor's horde and the other nation-states of Vaardland. She administered the introduction of the Greater Sphere to Vaardland, allowing its inhabitants to begin exploring the Spheres, and introducing them to the wonders and dangers of the cosmos. 

Approximately fifty years after Admiral Arandeiros opened the borders of Vaardland, the Armada granted Yapa Intersphereal Logistics use of it's hyperspace lanes, making them the only third party with sanctioned to use the fastest routes in Vaardspace. This decision was largely decried due to the perception that the fabulously wealthy Yapa clan had bribed Arandeiros. In fact, Mani Yapa, who had been something of a black sheep in the family, prevented an aberrant priest from creating a rift in the Concordance of spacetime and opening a portal to the Far Realm. Arandeiros recognized Mani's noble intentions and rewarded him with access to the Armada's routes.

About five years ago, the Emerald Armada declared open war with the Neogi Hegemony. The Neogi are seeking to invade Vaardspace and enslave it's entire population. For several hundred years prior, under Luthias Liaren, the Armada sought a diplomatic and peaceful coexistence with the neogi. Unfortunately, the neogi were negotiating in bad faith. The neogi's diplomatic efforts were a distraction so that the Armada would not notice that they were building an invasion force and attempting to infiltrate the Armada. During this period, the Hegemony's mages had learned to create living constructs called Warforged, whom the neogi would enslave and use as the body of the invasion force.

Admiral Arandeiros realized the neogi advance would not end through diplomatic efforts. After presenting her case, Armada command declared war against the Neogi Hegemony. Arandeiros conducted a swift and devastating counteroffensive. This has knocked the Neogi back on their heels, but open aggression is not the Neogi's most fluent tactic. Subterfuge is their trade and craft.
### Ancient History
The most pivotal moment in the history of the cosmos is the Disconcordance, which occurred approximately thirty thousand years ago. At that time, a human mage began experimenting with magical rites that would allow him to consume energy from other planes of existence. This human sought to surpass death and become a god. His name was Vecna.

The energy Vecna siphoned away shattered the barriers between planes of existence and manifolds of the material plane. This event is known as the Disconcordance. Vecna was defeated by an alliance of many sentient species, lead by a faction of dragons and high elves. The cosmos was healed. This turn of events served as the basis for the FaeDraconian calendar

Dragons have lived in the material plane as long as the plane has existed. Dragons who possessed the innate ability to traverse intersphereal space explored the cosmos as soon as they were physically capable. 

By various reckonings, other life appeared between one hundred million and five billion years before the Disconcordance. The earliest spacefaring species include the Arcane and the Juna. Both of these civilizations had faded by at least two hundred thousand years ago.
