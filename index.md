*We, the High Elves of the Emerald Enclave, in order to preserve the Fey Lifeblood, Causal Integrity, and Concordant Spacetime of the Greater Sagittarian Sphere and the Region of Vaardspace, do hereby pledge our allegiance to the Dragon-kin, known as The Children of Oshumare, and hereby commit ourselves to defend the temporal integrity of the Material Plane, to Protect the Greater Sphere from threats Near and Far, for the benefit of All Creatures who seek life and prosperity herein.*  
--Opening paragraph from the Vaardspace Protectorate Agreement.
## Intro
Vaardspace is a science fantasy RPG setting. It's inclusive of other settings like Forgotten Realms, Eberron, Dark Sun, and Grayhawk. It's a way for you to take your favorite character concepts and drop them into a gonzo setting. It's not just built by me, it's built by the players and what they bring to the game.

The word Vaardspace refers to the setting of the game, but within the game lore, Vaardspace is a region of the galaxy protected by the Emerald Armada.
## Cosmology
Most of the action takes place in a fantasy version of our galaxy. In the setting, it's called The Greater Sagittarian Sphere. More on spheres later.

The gods and planes of published DND settings exist within the greater cosmology of Vaardspace. So you can build a character using published options and that character will fit into Vaardspace.
### Crystal Spheres
Vaardspace borrows the idea of crystal spheres from Spelljammer. 

Spheres are magical objects that contain star systems and galaxies, and can only be detected by magical methods.
#### The Greater Sphere 
A greater sphere is a galaxy, and within the fiction of the game the word "galaxy" is a colloquial shorthand for "Greater Sphere." Greater spheres contain billions of lesser spheres, each with one or more quasi stellar objects at its center. Innumerable Greater Spheres exist in the cosmos although travel between them is impossible. There are no known hyperspace routes between Greater Spheres, and according to the dragons and the Emerald Armada, any hyperspace routes leading outside the Greater Sphere change course frequently and unpredictably. Nobody who has tried to plot hyperspace routes outside the Greater Sphere has returned.

Vaardspace is a region of planets inside the Greater Saggitarian Sphere, which is part of a large structure called The Laniakea Aspect.
#### Lesser Spheres
Lesser spheres contain star systems. Imagine a solar system in a fish bowl and you will understand a lesser sphere. Inside of a lesser sphere, ships cannot travel faster than the speed of light. 

When ships leave a lesser sphere, they can travel faster than the speed of light by travelling in hyperspace lanes through the Phlogiston.
#### Intersphereal Space 
Intersphereal Space is vast and empty. No same traveler would pass through intersphereal space to reach another sphere. The journey would take too long, and there is a risk of being attacked by space monsters or pirates.
### The Phlogiston
The Phlogiston is a higher dimensional space that allows faster than light travel between spheres. While inside the Phlogiston, you are surrounded by a background of swirling prismatic colors. That is because the phlogiston is an energy manifold and not a space manifold. The Phlogiston energies are highly reactive to beat and radiant energy, and can explode when in contact with open flame.

Inside the Phlogiston the distances between spheres is shorter. However, the background of stars is not visible on the phlogiston and so navigation is difficult. If you are not following an established hyperspace route, you could easily become lost forever. The swirling background of colors looks the same everywhere, so there is no frame of reference within the phlogiston.
### Hyperlanes
Hyperlanes are established routes through the phlogiston that connect spheres. They are defined by a series of vectors and course corrections made with specific timing. These course corrections are rotations of the vessel along its axes. There is no objective way to define a course through hyperspace, since the phlogiston has no navigational frame of reference, and so these rotations and timings must be made with careful accuracy.

Existing hyperspace lanes were established long ago. The shortest routes were created by a joint effort between ancient dragons and space faring elves. To this day, those routes are almost exclusively used by the Emerald Armada and the dragons. Anyone using these routes without express permission from the Armada or a writ of passage from a dragon are politely and firmly asked to use a different route.

Other routes exist and, while not as fast, relatively convenient for interstellar travel. Discovering new routes is a s difficult and dangerous process. One may accidentally end up lost in Intersphereal space or in the heart of a neutron star.
### Spelljamming
Spelljamming is the the process of using a spelljammer helm to propel a ship. A spelljammer helm is usually a chair with a helmet-like attachment that allows a magic user to convert a spell slot into propulsion power. A spelljammer helm will allow a ship to move at light speed within a crystal sphere, and will propel the ship into a hyperspace lane once at the sphere's edge. Intersphereal couriers and other long distance vessels will usually employ one or more spellcasters whose sole responsibility is ensuring they have enough spell slots to power their vessel.
### Beyond
If you ask a dragon, it will tell you that no hyper lanes connect the greater spheres to each other. This does not seem to be the whole truth, as credible hearsay indicates that the dragons have traveled to far-flung greater spheres.

In the vast emptiness between the spheres, horrors lurk. Things seep into the cosmos that should not be. The bigger and emptier the region, the more likely that such aberrations worm their way into the cosmos. Some legends say that such things have always existed, and we're present before the cosmos came into existence. Others say that they have come from another plane to predate on the creatures in our reality.
